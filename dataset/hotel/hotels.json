Just a short drive away from Moalboal and Panagsama, it offers a quiet, idyllic setting for your holiday. The location couldn't get any better for diving as one of the best reefs in the area is directly in front of your ocean view room. The reef is perfect for beginner divers, and also for snorkelers. However the step walls make an exhilarating dive for seasoned advanced divers. The resort's architecture is a blend of Mediterranean and native styles incorporating local stone and thatched roof with white arches and Spanish tiles. Each room has either a large arched doorway or huge glass sliding doors to provide guests with amazing ocean views. Fall asleep after a hard day's dive to the sound of gentle waves and the wind gently blowing through the yucca trees. Office hours: 8am to 8pm Email to arrange airport pickup with a minimum of 24 hour notice. Check -ins are to be arranged in advance if past or before normal office hours.",

It radiates a definitely not average hospitality experience with its personalized service, quirky décor and compelling design. All 62 spacious and cozy rooms and suites at The Henry Hotel Cebu each feature unique décor with every wall mural and quirky detail distinctly created by Cebuano artists, Mark Luzon and Mark “Kidlat” Copino ranging from a mural of Marilyn Monroe, Moroccan windows, a lady posing on her vintage convertible, a brick room to pastel or brightly colored walls even to the Philippine’s culture icons, celebrated festivals and modes of transportation to name a few. The visual appeal merged with the hotel’s artsy fun and personal service makes it a place worth staying in and going back to. The Henry is definitely becoming a “must-stay” place not just in Cebu, but also in the entire Philippines.",

It's holiday time: we wait for you! Malapascua is the beautiful small island of the Philippines hosting Tepanee: an intimate and friendly resort that will give you an unforgettable holiday. Tepanee stands on a small hill that rises up from Logon beach and our territory goes down to our own private sandy beach, an area isolated from the rest of the island from where it’s possible to admire breathtaking sunsets in an area secluded from the rest of the island and where we placed beach umbrellas, sunbeds, a gazebo for massages and our lovely Chiringuito beach bar. In addition, in the hill adjacent to the reception is our panoramic Amihan restaurant. The name TEPANEE comes from the name of the Polynesian frangipani plant, a tropical tree that graces our gardens with fragrant flowers of various colors. Historically, the concept for our resort followed a philosophy of low environment impact. Most of the building materials are natural and local: wood, bamboo and stones used for the main structures, roofs made of a typical straw named kogon. The buildings are almost invisible from the ocean, even if many are built right on the seaside. Opened on December 8, 2008, Tepanee in the beginning was consisted of 6 independent double cottages and one building of two storeyes with 4 triple rooms. We have grown, and can now offer you: Deluxe cottages: independent buildings with a superb ocean view, the best in Malapascua Island, facing the sundown. They feature: aircon, ceiling fan, en-suite bathroom, hot shower, minibar, safety box, balcony with sofa, queen size double bed with option for one or two extra single beds, bamboo and wooden furniture, wooden floor, entrance door and windows with mosquito screen and blackout curtains, free wifi, daily cleaning service.

There is also a fish sanctuary just outside the beach. The resort has 40 m white beach line and consists for the time being of 2 houses and a restaurant. The houses have high standard and a very nice garden with possibilities for several different activities like swimming in the swimming pool, mini golf, billiard, volleyball and relaxation beside the swimming pool or in one of the beach houses to mention a few. The houses have very nice terraces with sea view. The daily life on Olango Island has not changed significantly the last few generations, so tourists will have an exotic backpacker experience visiting the island.",

A barangay of the town of Daanbantayan, Malapascua Island takes pride in its world class diving spots and pristine white sand beaches. It is widely referred by locals as the \"Boracay of Cebu.\" As a diving destination, Malapascua Island has become known for its beautiful coral gardens and excellent local dive spots, as well as further out sites like Gato Island, Monad Shoal, and Kemod Shoal. Monad Shoal is an underwater plateau where thresher sharks and manta rays can be seen on a regular basis. The town's name is derived from two Spanish words, \"mal\" and \"pascua\", which translated in English means, \"bad\" and \"Easter\" or bad Christmas. According to locals, the Spaniards named the island that way after they arrived there on a stormy Christmas. Malapascua Island is a promise of a great dive and a relaxing beach experience, making it a popular travel destination for local and foreign tourists alike.",

It has stairs and handrail for to go down to the sea. It has a self made sand beach with beach volley ball, badminton and other games for our in house guest's free use. It has a great view to the clear blue sea. The difference between high and low tide here can vary vertically more than 3 meters depending on the position of the moon. The sea here has some very unique little animals because it has been reported that it was closed on its sides naturally many, many years ago. That's why some scientists are planning to study the phenomenon under sea level. From our sea shore of limestone with corals and sandy areas you can often observe sea turtles, especially when they swim up for air. The resort offers fresh air and tranquility for a great night sleep. Experience snorkeling, scuba diving or free diving. Just a short walk away you find also the well known White Beach. The resort has a size of around 5000 square meters (one of the largest resorts here) - that offers a lot of space, garden and possibilities for just 7 guestrooms and the resort practically has no neighbors - and most rooms have even built in noise reducers. These are great advantages in a lively country like that. The manager/co-owner of the resort loves the place so much he would never want to stay anywhere else.",

        "about": "Verbena Pension House soon to be transformed into Verbena Hotel to continue bringing you the comforts of a home. Verbena's drive towards uncompromising excellence in customer service and accommodation springs from a history that had become pivotal to this customer-focused business. Verbena had its humble beginning on May 3, 1976 as a small makeshift eatery. \"Cozy Nook\" was located in the garage of Engr. Pedro Urgello's duplex residence along \"Verbena Street,\" hence its name today. It served mainly taxi drivers trying to get hearty comfort food to get them through their daily grind. The dishes fish head tinola and caldereta were among the top sellers that drew attention to its customers. Eventually, the reputation of good and affordable food reached office workers of establishments within its vicinity who later made the place their regular eating place. Its popularity grew to gain the moniker \"Back Han Palace\" since it was located behind the former Great Han Palace restaurant. The proprietor, Justina T. Urgello, an insightful businesswoman and wife of Engr. Pedro Urgello, shelled out a meager amount about P 1,170 as capital for her small eatery which paid off when business boomed even more. Ten years later, in 1986, Mrs. Justina Urgello loaned P 150,000 from the bank for the construction of a 3-storey lodging house. This came about after her desire to open a safe, clean and affordable boarding/lodging house for medical students of the neighboring medical school. Mission: We commit to continuously offer excellent, convenient accommodation as well as quality and decent customer services to our valued guests. Vision To be recognized as best Pension House in Queen City of the South-Cebu.",

With 22 branches strategically located all over key places in the country, the GV Hotel Group has also become one of the largest provider of great value accommodations in the Philippine hospitality industry.With its rapid expansion in Visayas, Mindanao and Luzon since starting out in 1999, the GV Hotel Group has become synonymous with quality, service and value for money for the tourist, ahente (sales agent) and negosyante (businessmen/women) market. With no frills practical accommodation, the hotel caters to basic needs whilst ensuring a safe stay during one’s travels.As testimony to the company’s vision and commitment to providing affordable accommodation, GV Tower Hotel was completed in October 2006. The largest branch as of date (June 2013), the GV Tower can accommodate bigger functions and special events; and being one of the tallest buildings in downtown Cebu City, it offers an excellent view of the city and ease of access to the significant tourist spots, such as the Sto Nino Basilica & Magellan’s Cross, as well as access to the Major Markets in Downtown Cebu City.Staying at any GV Hotels is perfect if you’re traveling for business where you will spend most of your time outside on meetings and sales calls. It is also recommended if you’re a tourist who will be outside most of the time appreciating the history, culture, and beauty of the city and province you’re visiting. GV Hotels provides nothing fancy, but it can definitely be the home you can come to at the end of the day to get that good night’s rest.",

Voda Krasna has undergone a multitude of renovations and changes since its turnover and we are hopeful for the future, especially with the newly built bar and additional rooms, which will allow us to accommodate and satisfy more visitors. Currently, we have 3 villas, 4 standard rooms, 3 sea view suites and 4 beach huts available for rent. We also have beach tables and tent rentals for day use or overnight camping.",

        "about": "Located at the southern part of Cebu specifically at the municipality of Dalaguete in Barangay Coro, guests of Dakong Bato Beach and Leisure Resort are assured of no problem finding it as this has been used as a marker to signify entry into the said municipality. \"Dakong Bato\" translates to Big Rock in the English language. Once you will see the landmark just before you enter the resort's gate, you will instantly understand why such the name... For it literally is what it means. Dakong Bato and Leisure Resort offers fully-air conditioned rooms each with its own private bathroom, equipped with TV and DVD. Rooms can accommodate 2-10 people depending upon its size, whether for couples, families or barkadas. There are specially-designed rooms for workshops and teambuildings as well. Always out to give the best, quality service, this beach and leisure resort comes with free WiFi access to its guests and visitors. Cottages are available for guests who want to spend the day cooling themselves at the beach or taking a dip at its child-friendly spring water pool. The latter, by the way, comes with a slide and a jacuzzi that's perfect for instant relaxation via massage with warm waters. Manicured lawns adorn the whole resort resulting into a lot of nature green color meant to soothe and calm one's soul. For guests on their teambuilding, an array of activities await in line: For the sports buff, the basketball court and water volleyball at the pool are sure to give you good sweating and exercise. For the more adventurous spirit, there are rubber kayaks and dingy boats for rent and a cave adventure adds a cool twist to the otherwise laid-back atmosphere. Apart from this though, what also makes Dakong Bato Beach and Leisure Resort famous is its association to the Visayan folkore which tells the story of \"Maria Cacao\", the half immortal who made the huge stone the docking place of her golden ship which carried the cacao she sold to Manila and outside countries. Such is the reason why it is said that even if it has been many centuries already, the marker is said to be \"immovable\" and still literally growing.",

There is a very casual ‘make yourself at home’ kind of feeling to the lodge. Meals are buffet style and if guest join for dinner than all the guest dine at the same time. The cook here has a reputation to excel when it comes to local favorites. Meals are served in the lounge/sitting area and usually guests take their plate and eat on the outside patio. The Dive center is adjacent of the lodge… it doesn’t get easier than this. While you’re having breakfast the dive center staff is preparing your dive gear and you can watch them doing it. A no-nonsense accommodation; this is how it is; this is how we do it and we do it right! If you’re here to dive, then you’ve come to the right place.",

The year was 1995, when it was purchased the place was totally overhauled, refurbished, and remodelled but still retaining the original layout of the building and the number of rooms. It was a sound investment at that time and subsequently was also for the purpose of having a vacation home in Cebu for the family and close relatives, while in transit going to our home province in Leyte.Later on, due to the high demand for residential spaces and need for transient accommodations especially during peak seasons and of the Sinulog Festival every January, the seemingly quaint house was converted to a pension house with ten (10) room accommodation having a range guest capacity of 30 to 40 persons. Our place offers budget friendly standard to deluxe room accommodations located within the heart and vicinity of Cebu City. It is a bed and breakfast type of accommodation that have catered to tourists, transients, guests, and also to students.Our usual day can be best described as very quiet but mixed with the bustling sound of jeepneys and vehicles plying through the road. Our perimeter is well adept and curtained around with high walls and a big entrance gate. Thus our place is very much ideal for persons looking for accommodations that provide secluded yet quiet and comfortable space added with very secure and sound neighborhood.Today, in partnership with our sister company -- Luzviminda Travel and Tours, a full service travel agency and consultancy firm that offers complete tour packages in Cebu, Bohol, Cagayan De Oro, Palawan, and Boracay, we stand strong and committed to provide and deliver quality and high standard of hospitality services especially in terms of room accommodations and lodging.So come and stay with us... we are your \"home away from home\" here in Cebu City.",
